# 6 Tube Nixie Clock

This project was made by Jason Skells.

I discovered nixie tubes while browsing the internet not too long ago and I really enjoyed their aesthetic so I decided to make my own clock with 6 IN-14 Nixie Tubes.

These tubes were made between 1979 and 1982 and were taken off of some old soviet equipment.

I have smaller IN-3 tubes to be used as the colons and will be implemented when I have some more time to work on this project.

I also had tried to make my own high voltage power supply with a 555-timer but I encountered issues with the switching MOSFET and didn't have the equipment at the time to debug the circuit.

In the future, I plan on making my own high voltage switch mode power supply as well as encorporating the MCU and K155ID1 nixie driver chip onto a single PCB.
